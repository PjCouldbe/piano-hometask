# Piano-Hometask

This project introduces the utility of parsing natural language phrases for conversion info request to the object-based form. To test this utility you may build it manually with Maven and using the generated executable launcer-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar or use the prepared executable file in /exe folder by running the piano-hometask.bat file.
After launching you should see the empty console screen expecting your input. Type 'help' (without qoutes) to see documentation over the console utility and to get next instructions for input.
